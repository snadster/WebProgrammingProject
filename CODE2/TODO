DECOMPOSING INTO MICROSERVICES
individual services:
  - login (logic)
  - projects (database)
  - rendering (frontend)

login
  - flask can handle login so i don't understand why doing this
  - possible thing;
    - everytime we have to render something we need to check if user is logged in
    - we can throw that to logic?

projects
  - obvs databse stuff here. But its much more than just projects
  - everytime we need info from database, make call to here
  - send information from here as well

rendering
  - frontend things, the actual views. problem is currently the views do everything and we need to decompose that so they mostly do calls to logic and db, and then rendering.
  - essentially send out requests and get responses, and then based on those responses we either render or maybe throw error.
