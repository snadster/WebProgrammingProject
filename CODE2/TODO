fix phone combatability in sidebar.


MVP
- find way to keep navBar always on every page
  - currenlty just copy-pasting

- make the acessibility bulletproof 

- !! make auto generating code for displaying items for:
  - archive (MAYBE)
    - steal the projects one but filter by archived==True
  - counters
    - a counter has to know which project its in

- catch unique username error
  - somehow catch the mistake if two ppl with same username
  - and then somehow tell them
  - idfk

- delete pallete
  - ask user for pallette name
  - pass that to deletePallette view
  - use remove for the pallette with that name

BUGS
- text in sidebar is pink on dev notes page
- can't delete counters
- deleting a palette does not work.
- FIX DISPLAYING NAME OF COLOR PALETTE
- PROJECTS DON'T BELONG TO A USER.
  - i assume this is a db.session.scalar().all problem. I need to filter by userID.

REPORT:

scrapped
- we scrapped devNotes
- scrapped displaying the selected color palette in project
  - now only display name
- linked and looped counters
  - find the ghosts of this in the code for part one. Left for possible future implementation
- we scrapped note-taking : time constraint. 
  - you'll find the remnants of it in the code for part one. left for possible future implementation

general notes:
- scrollbars are not styled, as most of the aesthetics were done on a firefox browser, where scrollbars collapse when not in use. If you're using edge or another browser with non-collapsing scroll-bars, I do apologize





NOTE TO SELF:
on projects:
  hopefully, it should work like this:
  - user clicks new project, and flask runs /newProject, rendering
    the template of a new project with default values.
  - user clicks save on form to save details, and flask runs /saveProject.
    this redirects to /project/projectID, and should now have the 
    correct information.
      - POSSIBLE BUG: project will only save if user saves info. However, 
        user has to save info to give the project a title.
  - user can now interact with their brand new project.


OLD CODE
display selected color palette
