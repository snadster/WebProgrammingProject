fix phone combatability in sidebar.


MVP
- find way to keep navBar always on every page
  - currenlty just copy-pasting

- make the acessibility bulletproof 

- !! make auto generating code for displaying items for:
  - archive (MAYBE)
    - steal the projects one but filter by archived==True
  - counters
    - a counter has to know which project its in

- make code so counters actually work.

- catch unique username error
  - somehow catch the mistake if two ppl with same username
  - and then somehow tell them
  - idfk

- delete pallete
  - ask user for pallette name
  - pass that to deletePallette view
  - use remove for the pallette with that name

- add persistence on tabs 

BUGS
- text in sidebar is pink on dev notes page
- can't delete counters
- theme button no longer works (apparently /clicked doesnt exist even tho im looking at it with my eyeballs.)
- sometimes the theme changes when adding a counter


SCRAPPED
- we scrapped devNotes
- scrapped displaying the selected color palette in project
- linked and looped counters


NOTE TO SELF:

on projects:
  hopefully, it should work like this:
  - user clicks new project, and flask runs /newProject, rendering
    the template of a new project with default values.
  - user clicks save on form to save details, and flask runs /saveProject.
    this redirects to /project/<projectID>, and should now have the 
    correct information.
      - POSSIBLE BUG: project will only save if user saves info. However, 
        user has to save info to give the project a title.
  - user can now interact with their brand new project.

OLD CODE
display selected color palette
