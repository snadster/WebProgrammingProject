fix phone combatability in sidebar.


MVP
- remove layout possibly (check how hard to do)
- add note option with built layout (for optimum data scraping)
- find way to keep navBar always on every page
- make the acessibility bulletproof 
- !! make auto generating code for displaying items for:
  - color palettes
  - projects
    - not only generate a whole page for one project but also add it to the list of projects (what jonathan did)
  - dev notes
  - archive
    - steal the projects one but filter by archived==True
- a counter has to know which project its in
