fix phone combatability in sidebar.


MVP
- finish setting up database
- find way to keep navBar always on every page
- make the acessibility bulletproof 
- !! make auto generating code for displaying items for:
  - color palettes
    - in pallets
    - pull them to info page by name from database and display them using auto gen code
  - projects
    - not only generate a whole page for one project but also add it to the list of projects (what jonathan did)
  - dev notes
    - from a txt document or the like.
  - archive
    - steal the projects one but filter by archived==True
  - counters
    - a counter has to know which project its in

- make code so counters actually work.
- scrape data from built in info thing
  - put that somewhere in a database
- front page / login
- profile page
