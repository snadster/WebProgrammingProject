fix phone combatability in sidebar.


MVP
- finish setting up database

- find way to keep navBar always on every page
  - currenlty just copy-pasting

- make the acessibility bulletproof 

- !! make auto generating code for displaying items for:
  - color palettes
    - in pallets
    - pull them to info page by name from database and display them using auto gen code
  - projects
    - not only generate a whole page for one project but also add it to the list of projects (what jonathan did)
  - archive
    - steal the projects one but filter by archived==True
  - counters
    - a counter has to know which project its in

- make code so counters actually work.

- scrape data from built in info thing
  - put that somewhere in a database

- pass on the palette (and the projects) when rendering template
  - so the autogen code can work

- currently ignoring how to render a palette on a projects page 
  bc I can't be bothered

BUGS
- User.username somehow doesn't access the db and doesn't get the username.
- text in sidebar is pink on dev notes page


SCRAPPED
- we scrapped devNotes
